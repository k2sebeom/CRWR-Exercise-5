                Narrator: Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of “who moved my cheese!” Today, we’re investigating a strange case of missing cheese that happened on a college campus located in Oberlin, Ohio.
            </p>

            <p>
                Narrator: College life is not easy, and if you're living on campus in a residence hall, it adds another layer of trouble to your life. You may argue with your roommate, you might get into a fight with your loud upstairs neighborhood, !or you may encounter a serial cheese theft lurking in your residence hall. Peter Kim, a sophomore at Oberlin College reported that his cheese in a public refrigerator in the kitchen went missing multiple times.

            <p>
                So Mr Kim, when did you find that your cheese was missing?
            </p>

            <p>
                Peter: It was ah… Friday night. I had a rough day because I had like three problem sets due. I just wanted to cook some mac and cheese, grab a coke, and make a day of it, but when I opened the refrigerator, I found that my cheese was missing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Narrator: Witnessing this tragic crime scene, Peter was shocked, but since it was the first time that his food went missing, he just decided to buy another box of cheese. However, this cold-blooded serial cheese theft did not stop.
            </p>

            <p>
                So Mr Kim, what happened to your new cheese?
            </p>

            <p>
                Peter: I thought someone had made a mistake, so I placed my cheese in a big black box, and wrote a memo on it saying "Property of Peter Kim.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Narrator: On Sunday morning however, Peter could not believe his eyes when he opened the refrigerator, as he found out that the entire box went missing. The grand theft cheese was real.
            </p>

            <p>
                Narrator: To find this shameless rat, we asked ten different students whether they saw anything suspicious on Saturday night. They all said that they could not remember what happened that night. It is often very difficult to identify a thief when the crime took place in a refrigerator located in a public space. Will there be another victim of this monstrous crime? Will there be another innocent student whose precious weekend with a warm good meal is taken away? Until we catch this criminal redhanded, I warn you all, keep your food safe, because someone may move your cheese.
